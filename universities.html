			</br></br><h3>Natalie Chen, President</h3>
			Hello! I am currently a second-year student at UCI, majoring in Public Health sciences. I joined MHI in hopes that my teammates and I can have a significant impact in reducing the spread of Covid-19 in disadvantaged communities. As co-president, my responsibilities included initiating the new club registration process at UCI and assigning specific roles to incoming members. I have loved collaborating with others on this very important goal and am excited to meet more newcomers joining our team. Outside of MHI, I have enjoyed volunteering at hospitals, assisting children in after-school programs, swimming, and exploring new places in SoCal. In the future, I envision myself pursuing a career in epidemiology and disease prevention. Overall, I hope I can dedicate my career to mitigating the quantity of preventable deaths on a national, or even global scale.

			Ahoy there! I am a 2nd year UCI Biological Sciences Major, currently residing in my family home in sunny SoCal. I’m an aspiring cardiologist by day, Minecraft player by night. During the in-between, I spend my time tutoring middle and high school students in biology, chemistry, and English. I’ve also been fortunate enough to do research in the cardiology division of Kaiser Riverside on possible new treatments for atrial fibrillation patients. In my other-other spare time, I enjoy writing, drawing and embroidery (better for stitching up future patients, I like to say!)

			</br></br><h3>William Chung, President</h3>
			Hello! My name is William Chung and I am a second year computer science major at UCSD. One of my hopes for the future is to be able to apply what I am learning now to a worthwhile and beneficial cause, a hope that has in part led me to Masked Heroes Initiative. I joined MHI as a way to contribute to combating the COVID-19 public health crisis because I believed that the only way to get through it is together. Since joining, my belief in community action and service has only been strengthened. I am looking forward to all the amazing work that MHI and my branch at UCSD will accomplish, and I am grateful to be a part of it all. On a more personal note, in my free time I enjoy spending time with family and friends and just exploring, from exploring nature to exploring topics I haven’t learned about before!

			</br></br><h3>Adele Hong, Board Member</h3>
			Hello! I am currently a second-year general biology major at the University of California, San Diego. My responsibilities in MHI include assisting the President with planning and organizational tasks. As a secretary, I also document important points of discussion for meeting minutes. I joined MHI to help those especially impacted by the pandemic and to collaborate with others across campuses to achieve a common ambition. My goal for MHI at UCSD is to relieve resource shortages for essential workers beyond the La Jolla area. Aside from my involvement with MHI, I am a mentor to first generation, low-income students in the Triton Leadership Community Institute, which further contributes to my passion for serving disadvantaged groups and working towards social equity. My passion extends beyond helping others and includes dancing, kite-flying, and engaging in philosophical discourse.

			Hi, my name is Carlo Miguel Ong, but most people call me Miggy. I am a second year human biology major with a minor in psychology at UCSD. I am currently pursuing a career in the medical field, however, I am open to all types of work relating to healthcare. Due to the pandemic, I am currently back home with my family in the Philippines. I’ve lived most of my life in the Philippines, but I have also spent a significant number of years living in Singapore. I’m excited to be a part of the establishment of the MHI UCSD branch, and look forward to being able to contribute to the community. In my free time I enjoy watching TV shows, basketball, and soccer.
