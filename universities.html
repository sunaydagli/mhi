Some things I like to do in my free time are watch and play sports, TV shows, and movies, as well as exercise.I started the Masked Heroes Initiative because I believe that we cannot sit on the sidelines and expect for COVID-19 to disappear.

			Hello! I am currently a second-year student at UCI, majoring in Public Health sciences. I joined MHI in hopes that my teammates and I can have a significant impact in reducing the spread of Covid-19 in disadvantaged communities. As co-president, my responsibilities included initiating the new club registration process at UCI and assigning specific roles to incoming members. I have loved collaborating with others on this very important goal and am excited to meet more newcomers joining our team. Outside of MHI, I have enjoyed volunteering at hospitals, assisting children in after-school programs, swimming, and exploring new places in SoCal. In the future, I envision myself pursuing a career in epidemiology and disease prevention. Overall, I hope I can dedicate my career to mitigating the quantity of preventable deaths on a national, or even global scale.

During the in-between, I spend my time tutoring middle and high school students in biology, chemistry, and English. I’ve also been fortunate enough to do research in the cardiology division of Kaiser Riverside on possible new treatments for atrial fibrillation patients. In my other-other spare time, I enjoy writing, drawing and embroidery (better for stitching up future patients, I like to say!)

One subject of interest is drawing connections between genetic aberrations and organismal behaviors. I joined MHI because I strongly believe in providing equitable access to PPE and healthcare for socioeconomically disadvantaged communities; due to my past experiences as Treasurer and Secretary of my high school’s Key Club, I can make the biggest impact working in Internal Finances. In my free time I enjoy drinking tea, longboarding, playing ping pong, and learning how to cook without burning my food.

			</br></br><h3>Julian Shin</h3>
			Whats up! My name is Julian Shin and I am currently a 2nd year student studying Film at UC Irvine where I hope to work in the entertainment industry some day. One of the reasons I decided to join MHI was to be able to help those communities who have been impacted by COVID and to help our healthcare workers fight against this pandemic. It takes all of us to fight against this pandemic and we still have a long way to go in order for our world to be safe. On my own time, I enjoy playing my favorite songs on my electric guitar, taking film photos, and snowboarding.

			Hi friends! My name is Callie, I’m a freshman at UC Irvine studying Drama, and I hope to double major in Criminology, Law, and Society as well as minor Music. I also study circus arts at Ruby Karen Project and Tae Kwon Do at Shambala Black Belts Dojo. I run an activism account on instagram @pinchofactivism, play keyboard and sing in my friend’s band, write music and sci-fi novels in my free time as well as participate in social activism and creative composition in general. I connect our team with protests and organizers to donate masks in the recent Black Lives Matter marches and interact with people who could support our cause. Thank you to everyone who has! I hope to be able to connect with you all one way or another.

			Hello! My name is William Chung and I am a second year computer science major at UCSD. One of my hopes for the future is to be able to apply what I am learning now to a worthwhile and beneficial cause, a hope that has in part led me to Masked Heroes Initiative. I joined MHI as a way to contribute to combating the COVID-19 public health crisis because I believed that the only way to get through it is together. Since joining, my belief in community action and service has only been strengthened. I am looking forward to all the amazing work that MHI and my branch at UCSD will accomplish, and I am grateful to be a part of it all. On a more personal note, in my free time I enjoy spending time with family and friends and just exploring, from exploring nature to exploring topics I haven’t learned about before!

			</br></br><h3>Adele Hong, Vice President</h3>
			Hello! I am currently a second-year general biology major at the University of California, San Diego. My responsibilities in MHI include assisting the President with planning and organizational tasks. As a secretary, I also document important points of discussion for meeting minutes. I joined MHI to help those especially impacted by the pandemic and to collaborate with others across campuses to achieve a common ambition. My goal for MHI at UCSD is to relieve resource shortages for essential workers beyond the La Jolla area. Aside from my involvement with MHI, I am a mentor to first generation, low-income students in the Triton Leadership Community Institute, which further contributes to my passion for serving disadvantaged groups and working towards social equity. My passion extends beyond helping others and includes dancing, kite-flying, and engaging in philosophical discourse.

			Hi, my name is Angela Park, and I am a first year theatre student at UC San Diego. I am interested specifically in the performance and stage management of theatre. I hope to gain, with my involvement in operations, more experience interacting with other people and therefore, better communication skills. My passion for assisting underprivileged people began in high school when I volunteered at a Bread of Angels facility to feed the hungry. I hope to use this passion in a beneficial way through MHI. When I have free time, I enjoy listening to K-pop and musical soundtracks, watching movies and dramas, and reading books of multiple genres.
