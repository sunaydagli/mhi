                <h3>Jay Kim-Turner</h4>
                <h5>Founder, President</h5>
                I am a sophomore attending the University of California, Berkeley studying political science and economics. In the past, I have heavily been involved in speech and debate events, with a particular emphasis on Parliamentary debate and Impromptu speech. I had the high honor of serving as President of my high school’s Speech and Debate team during my senior year. Some things I like to do in my free time are watch and play sports, TV shows, and movies, as well as exercise.I started the Masked Heroes Initiative because I believe that we cannot sit on the sidelines and expect for COVID-19 to disappear. It is up to us — all of us — to actively defeat it together and put this crisis behind us.</p>

                    <h5>Director of Operations</h5>
                    Hello! I am a sophomore at UCLA, intending to major in Psychobiology. I plan on pursuing a career in the medical field/healthcare administration. As Director of Operations, I oversee the operational functions of MHI, including the coordination/allocation of quality mask shipments, as well as outreach, partnerships, and overall service. At UCLA, I serve as the Education and Outreach Coordinator for MEDlife, a student organization dedicated to serving low-income families around the world by reducing health disparities. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis with friends, trying exotic foods, travelling, and doing impressions of movie characters!

                    <h3>Brian Trinh</h4>
                    <h5>Director of Internal Finances</h5>
                    I am a student at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering and minors in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Engineering. I love two things: math and piano. Piano is my favorite hobby because music is so universal and a great way to convey emotions. I am also involved with VSA in Cal Poly Pomona. Masked Heroes Initiative is a way I can give back to the community by supplying PPE to those who desperately need it. In MHI, I oversee all internal financial activities of MHI to ensure proper management of funds.

                    <h5>Director of Social Media</h5>
                    I am an incoming freshman at the University of Southern California as a Law, History, and Culture major with a pre-law emphasis. I have had the privilege of participating in various activities throughout high school such as TEDx, Link Crew, and an exchange program to Japan. I plan to continue mock trial, which was my biggest commitment in high school, at the collegiate level. Also, I hope to further immerse myself in East Asian cultural studies to learn more about my own heritage. As a person who has an interest in activism and raising awareness of current issues, I help manage MHI’s various platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook.

                    <h3>Daanesh Jamal</h4>
                    <h5>Head Blog Editor</h5>
                    Hello! I am a rising freshman who will attend Rice University in the fall with a major in Political Science and a Pre-Law Emphasis. In high school, I participated in the Parliamentary, Speech & Debate Club, Academic Decathlon, and TEDx Programs, which all kindled my passion for learning about and discussing big issues. I fed my desire to get involved in my community by volunteering in several political campaigns, including runs for the California State Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. I hope to marry my love of problem-solving and appreciation for community service as I work as the Assistant Operations Officer. Feel free to contact me at dhj1@rice.edu if you have any questions about MHI.

                    <h3>Peggy Zhou</h4>
                    <h5>Graphic Designer</h5>
                    I am a graduating student at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona majoring in Visual Communication Design. My design style is known to be “playful” because I tend to subtly mash my hobbies, thoughts, and personality into my designs. While in college, I joined and volunteered in various cultural organizations and events. When I have extra time on my hands, I enjoy trying new recipes, playing games, and doing yoga. My role in MHI is to design content for social media platforms; I hope to make a difference in today’s current events by communicating through design.

                    Hi! My name is Kenton Trinh and I am the youngest member of this organization. I am currently a senior at Valencia High School. I plan to possibly study chemistry or music when I get into college. In my free time, I like to play video games with my brother, talk with friends, and read. As Secretary, I document weekly meetings, compile biweekly reports on all donations and expenditures at MHI, and assist in any and all projects.
