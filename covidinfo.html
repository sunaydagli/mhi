			<h2>What Is it?</h2>
				<p>
					COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms may show up 2-14 days after exposure to the virus in the form of a fever, coughing, and shortness of breath (not limited to this). The virus is highly contagious and is mainly spread from person to person through close contact with other people and through respiratory droplets (coughing, sneezing, talking). However, the virus may also spread even if people are not showing symptoms (asymptomatic) and by touching objects or surfaces that have the virus on them. It has also been recently reported that the coronavirus is starting to make its way into younger populations.
				<p>
			<h2>The Importance of Masks</h2>
			<p>Given that the virus is primarily spread through respiratory droplets, it is vitally important to wear masks and other forms of personal protective equipment (gloves). Masks provide a barrier to the release of your own respiratory droplets that could otherwise end up in the air and onto other people.</p>

			<h2>Types of Masks</h2>
			
			<p><span class="image right"><img class="covidmask" src="images/dispmask1.png" alt="" /></a></span>
				<h3>Surgical and Disposable Masks</h3>Surgical masks are loose-fitting, disposable masks that offer protection from large particles. They are primarily effective in preventing the spread of respiratory droplets to others.

				<h3>N95 Respirators</h3>N95 respirators offer additional protection compared to the typical surgical mask because they are able to filter out large and small particles. They provide a tight seal on the face and as a result, oftentimes, have valves that make them easier to breathe through. However, with these types of masks, when the wearer exhales, unfiltered air is released, meaning that it does not always prevent the spread of the virus. These types of masks should be reserved for front-line healthcare workers.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Shortage of masks in the United States
			</h2>
			<p>With the surge of new coronavirus cases across the United States, the supply of masks has struggled to keep up with the high demand for them, especially with regards to N95 masks being provided to front-line workers. However, what is more concerning is the uneven distribution of masks to hospitals and other facilities. Better-resourced hospitals are currently receiving sufficient supplies, while poorer-resourced facilities are struggling to receive shipments of personal protective equipment. “The Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid reported that one in five Florida nursing homes do not have a one-week supply of gowns or N95 masks to care for COVID-19 patients.” This is merely one example of the uneven distribution of personal protective equipment throughout the United States.</p>
