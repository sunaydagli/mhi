			</br></br><h3>Jay Kim-Turner, Founder and President</h3>
			I am a sophomore attending the University of California, Berkeley studying political science and economics. In the past, I have heavily been involved in speech and debate events, with a particular emphasis on Parliamentary debate and Impromptu speech. I had the high honor of serving as President of my high school’s Speech and Debate team during my senior year. Some things I like to do in my free time are watch and play sports, TV shows, and movies, as well as exercise.I started the Masked Heroes Initiative because I believe that we cannot sit on the sidelines and expect for COVID-19 to disappear. It is up to us — all of us — to actively defeat it together and put this crisis behind us.

			Hello, my name is Brian Trinh.

In MHI, I oversee all internal financial activities of MHI to ensure proper management of funds.
