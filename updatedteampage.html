			I am a sophomore attending the University of California, Berkeley studying political science and economics. In the past, I have heavily been involved in speech and debate events, with a particular emphasis on Parliamentary debate and Impromptu speech. I had the high honor of serving as President of my high school’s Speech and Debate team during my senior year. Some things I like to do in my free time are watch and play sports, TV shows, and movies, as well as exercise.I started the Masked Heroes Initiative because I believe that we cannot sit on the sidelines and expect for COVID-19 to disappear. It is up to us — all of us — to actively defeat it together and put this crisis behind us.

			</br></br><h3>Andrew Liang, Operations Associate</h3>
			Hi! My name is Andrew Liang and I am a second year undergraduate student at UCLA majoring in Molecular Cell and Developmental Biology (MCDB).  As a part of the MHI Operations committee, I actively work alongside Operation board members to organize wholesale purchases, contact suppliers, and deliver masks to places in need throughout SoCal.

			</br></br><h3>Donovan Maunahan, Operations Associate</h3>
			Heyo! My name is Donovan Maunahan and I am a second year at San Francisco State University currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing. In my time of being a volunteer at a hospital in San Francisco I was able to witness firsthand, the health inequities found within my community as well as serve those within underprivileged communities. That is one of the reasons why I was passionate about joining MHI. I wanted to help out and continue serving those within underprivileged communities. In the future, I hope to pursue a career in nursing in the military, Emergency Room, or pediatrics. In my free time, I love to cook and experiment with new recipes, sing terribly in karaoke, and watch movies! As a member of the MHI Operations committee, I actively work alongside Operation board members to organize and deliver masks to places in need throughout the Bay Area.
